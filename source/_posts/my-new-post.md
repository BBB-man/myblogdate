## The news is two months ago, just for practice.
"Peace"在黑市上出售200万雅虎账号，以后在网络上不能随便填写真实信息了...

### 吃点心//Info:
“Peace” aka “Peace_of_mind”, the hacker behind the Myspace, Tumblr, Twitter and LinkedIn attacks, is allegedly selling 200 million Yahoo user details for 3 bitcoins (around $1,860) on the Real Deal, a dark web marketplace.

Although the legitimacy of the data is still questioned, Yahoo confirmed for Motherboard that they “were aware of the claim”. The hacker claims the data is from 2012 and, similarly to his previous attacks, it contains stolen usernames, hashed passwords and birth dates.

As reported by Motherboard, following an internal investigation some of the accounts turned out to be shut off, thus the list is a mix of both disabled and legitimate accounts.

“We are committed to protecting the security of our users’ information and we take any such claim very seriously. Our security team is working to determine the facts,” said a company spokesperson. “Yahoo works hard to keep our users safe, and we always encourage our users to create strong passwords, or give up passwords altogether by using Yahoo Account Key, and use different passwords for different platforms.”

The hacker had previously claimed association with a Russian group focused on tech firms, according to an interview for Wired. In spite of their unknown identity, the group is held accountable for the hacks on LinkedIn, Myspace and Russian social media channel VK.com.
